ping-monitor
============

A simple ping monitor. Once it's down, you chose what to do (such as sending emails or run system functions)

- Download the bash script, make sure you look at the comments because you need to add what you plan on doing when the server goes up or down. Currently, mine is set to send a text message via email. <br>
- Add the servers you want to monitor (works best with domains / subdomains) to monitorList
- I run my monitor.sh in a tmux session ( screen works too )
